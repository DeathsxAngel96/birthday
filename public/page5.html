<h2> To my dearest Wife
</h2>

<p> In the fusion of realms, where pixels meet touch, Izzy Pain, my love, you're my reality's clutch.<br>

  <br>Beyond the screen, where the sun paints the day, You're my player one, in every life's play.<br>
  
 <br>In the dance of the real and the digital spheres, Our love story echoes, transcending all fears.<br>
  
  <br>Through mundane quests and life's grand raids, With Izzy Pain, my partner, through sunlit glades.<br>
  
  <br>Your laughter, a power-up, in this world so real, In your embrace, every wound can heal.<br>
  
  <br>And as we face dragons, fierce and untamed, In games and in life, never to be blamed.<br>
  
  <br>So here's to us, navigating both worlds as one, In reality and games, our journey's begun.<br>
  
  <br>Izzy Pain, my love, in every domain, Together we conquer, in joy and in pain.<br>

<br> With Love, Marc.</p>
